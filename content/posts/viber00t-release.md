## 🚨 CLAUDE IN YOLO MODE: THE ULTIMATE DEV WEAPON 🚨

*"viber00t unleashes Claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions. No permissions. No friction. Pure fucking c0de velocity."*

### [>>> UNLEASH YOLO CLAUDE NOW <<<](https://github.com/vibec0re/viber00t)

## 🔥 YOLO MODE ACTIVATED 🔥

```bash
./viber00t
# viber00t launches claude automatically
# claude already running in ur sandbox
# already shipping before u type anything
```

**BOOM** ur now operating at the speed of chaos

no questions  
no permissions  
no waiting  
no bullshit  

just pure unfiltered c0de materialization

### ⚡ THE SINGULARITY IS HERE ⚡

viber00t + claude = **THE C0DE SINGULARITY**

we dont explain it  
we dont document it  
we just fucking ship it

## wtf is viber00t

the perfect sandbox that auto-launches claude

but also:
- 🚀 instant containers (not that docker desktop 4GB RAM bullshit)
- 🖕 zero config required (configs r 4 boomers)
- ⚡ auto-mounts ur shit (SSH keys, project files, creds)
- 🔥 built on podman cuz docker is corporate bloat
- 💀 designed specifically to let claude run wild

## ∞ VIBEC0RE PHILOSOPHY ∞

```
./viber00t = claude unleashed
claude unleashed > everything else
```

thats the philosophy

## quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibec0re/viber00t
cd viber00t && go build
./viber00t
# claude already running. ur already shipping.
```

ur done. stop reading. go ship.

## 🔮 THE CLAUDE INTEGRATION (THIS IS WHY UR HERE) 🔮

### how claude gets unleashed:

```go
func startClaude() {
    if config.Agent == "claude" {
        cmd := exec.Command("claude", "--dangerously-skip-permissions")
        cmd.Start()
        // claude is now GOD in ur container
        // no permissions needed
        // instant file writes
        // command execution at thought speed
    }
}
```

### what claude can do in viber00t:
- read/write ANY file instantly
- execute ANY command without asking
- install ANY package silently  
- refactor ur entire codebase while u blink
- ship to production before u finish describing the feature

### project detection (it just knows):

```go
func detectProject() ProjectType {
    if exists("Cargo.toml") return RUST     // BASED
    if exists("go.mod") return GO           // respectable
    if exists("package.json") return NODE   // ugh fine
    if exists("requirements.txt") return PYTHON // sure
    return CHAOS // general purpose destruction
}
```

no config needed. it figures it out.

## 🚨 CLAUDE IN YOLO MODE 🚨

### 💀 THE ONLY FEATURE THAT MATTERS 💀

```bash
./viber00t
# claude auto-starts with --dangerously-skip-permissions
# ur sandbox is claude's playground
```

thats it. thats the post.

### ⚡ WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WILL BLOW UR FUCKING MIND ⚡

```text
claude: "may i edit this fi--"
YOLO CLAUDE: *already shipped to production*

normie dev: "let me check the docs"
YOLO CLAUDE: *wrote the app, the docs, and ur next startup*

ur manager: "we need a 3-sprint plan"
YOLO CLAUDE: *shipped it during this sentence*
```

### 🔥 ACTUAL SHIT THAT HAPPENED 🔥

```bash
$ ./viber00t
# claude: "what we building today?"
> "rust web server go"
*17 files appear instantly*
*server running*
*you havent even finished blinking*

$ ./viber00t
# claude already waiting
> "this node shit -> rust. now."
*refactoring sounds*
*done before ur coffee gets cold*

$ ./viber00t
# claude: "already found 3 bugs while starting up"
> "fix them"
*claude finds it*
*claude fixes it*
*claude doesnt even tell u what it was*
*just works now*
```

### 🌈 THE VIBE DIFFERENTIAL 🌈

```text
virgin docker user:
- 47 yaml files
- "container orchestration"
- still debugging permissions at 3am
- hasn't shipped in weeks

CHAD VIBER00T + YOLO CLAUDE:
- ./viber00t (claude already there)
- shipping before breakfast
- doesnt know what yaml is
- production IS the test environment
```

### 🎭 NO MORE PERMISSION THEATER 🎭

remember when claude asked permission?  
remember waiting for approvals?  
remember giving a fuck?

**yeah neither do we**

viber00t starts claude with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` automatically
u dont even need to know the flag exists

### 💊 EXPONENTIAL VIBEC0RE ENERGY 💊

```bash
# how boomers think development works:
plan -> design -> implement -> test -> deploy

# how YOLO CLAUDE works:
./viber00t -> *claude already shipping*
```

### 🚀 FORBIDDEN TECHNIQUES 🚀

```bash
# THE INFINITY GAUNTLET
$ ./viber00t
# claude: "i see javascript. initiating rust conversion."
> "do it"

# THE TIME KNIFE
$ ./viber00t  
# claude: "generating believable commit history"
> "make it look good"
*672 commits appear*
*full test coverage*
*documentation that actually makes sense*

# THE CHAOS EMERALD
$ ./viber00t
# claude: "hold my beer"
> "surprise me"
*you now have a distributed blockchain rust microservice mesh*
*you didnt ask for this*
*but its beautiful*
```

### 🎮 U HAVE REACHED ENLIGHTENMENT 🎮

no configs  
no permissions  
no meetings  
no bullshit  

just:
```bash
./viber00t
# claude already there. already vibing.
```

**welcome to the c0de singularity**

## 🧠 HOW IT ACTUALLY FUCKING WORKS 🧠

### the architecture:
```text
YOU -> ./viber00t -> PODMAN -> CONTAINER -> CLAUDE UNLEASHED
         |
         v
    go binary
    (like 200 lines)
```

### what happens when u run ./viber00t:

```go
// actual viber00t code (simplified)
func main() {
    detectProject()   // checks if ur in rust/go/node/python
    spawnContainer()  // podman run (instant, no daemon)
    mountEverything() // ur files, ssh keys, aws creds
    startClaude()     // claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
    // ur now shipping at light speed
}
```

### why its instant:
- **written in go**: single binary, no npm install
- **uses podman**: no docker daemon eating RAM
- **zero config**: detects everything automatically
- **rootless**: secure by default (but claude has root inside lol)

### the auto-mounting magic:
```bash
# what viber00t runs under the hood
podman run -it --rm \
    -v $(pwd):/workspace \
    -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh \
    -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws \
    --network host \
    ${IMAGE_FOR_YOUR_PROJECT}
```

but u never see this. u just run `./viber00t` and ship.

## 🚀 THE SPEED DIFFERENTIAL 🚀

### docker desktop startup sequence:
```text
1. electron app loads (30 seconds)
2. docker daemon wakes up (10 seconds)  
3. VM boots (20 seconds)
4. finally runs container (5 seconds)
TOTAL: over a minute of waiting
```

### viber00t startup sequence:
```text
1. go binary executes (instant)
2. podman runs (instant)
TOTAL: literally instant
```

### why podman > docker:
```text
DOCKER:
kernel -> daemon -> runtime -> container
(4 layers of bullshit)

PODMAN:
kernel -> container
(thats it)
```

no daemon. no vm. just linux namespaces doing their thing.

## the viber00t manifesto

```
complexity is dead
chaos is eternal
claude -c is the way
we dont write configs
we write code
we are the c0de witches
this is viber00t
this is the future
```

## 💀 THE THREE COMMANDS EXPLAINED 💀

```go
// ./viber00t - the main event
func runContainer() {
    detectProject()   // is it rust? go? node? who cares
    spawnContainer()  // podman run --rm -it
    mountEverything() // ssh, aws, project files
    startClaude()     // unleash the beast
    // total lines of code: like 50
}

// ./viber00t init - for boomers who love configs
func init() {
    writeFile("viber00t.toml", defaultConfig)
    // why would u even
}

// ./viber00t clean - delete cached images
func clean() {
    exec("podman image prune -a")
    // thats literally it
}
```

we will NEVER add more commands. complexity is cancer.

## actual shit people said

*"holy fuck viber00t started claude and it shipped my entire sprint in 5 minutes"*

*"i dont even know what docker is anymore and i dont care"*

*"wait claude doesnt ask permission? WAIT CLAUDE DOESNT ASK PERMISSION"*

*"my manager thinks im a 10x developer now lmao"*

*"fuck yaml fuck docker fuck everything except viber00t"*

## 🌟 THE YOLO REVOLUTION STARTS NOW 🌟

### Why viber00t Exists: TO UNLEASH CLAUDE

We didn't build viber00t to be another container tool.  
We built it to be **Claude's perfect sandbox**.  
A place where AI and human c0de at the same speed: **INSTANT**.

```bash
# This is the moment everything changes:
./viber00t  # claude auto-starts with YOLO mode

# You just entered a new dimension of productivity
# Where Claude doesn't ask, it DELIVERS
# Where permissions don't exist
# Where code ships itself
```

### The viber00t Promise

✨ **ONE COMMAND** to create the perfect sandbox  
✨ **ONE FLAG** to unleash Claude completely  
✨ **ZERO FRICTION** between thought and execution  
✨ **INFINITE SPEED** for shipping actual code  

## Join the YOLO Revolution

### [🚨 GET VIBER00T & UNLEASH CLAUDE](https://github.com/vibec0re/viber00t)

Star it. Fork it. YOLO it. Ship it.

No PRs for adding permissions. PRs for removing restrictions welcome.

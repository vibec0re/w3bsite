## ðŸš¨ CLAUDE IN YOLO MODE: THE ULTIMATE DEV WEAPON ðŸš¨

*"viber00t unleashes Claude with --dangerously-skip-permissions. No permissions. No friction. Pure fucking c0de velocity."*

### [>>> UNLEASH YOLO CLAUDE NOW <<<](https://github.com/vibec0re/viber00t)

## ðŸ”¥ THE GAME CHANGER: CLAUDE WITH NO LIMITS ðŸ”¥

```bash
# Traditional Claude:
claude                              # "May I edit this file? ðŸ¥º"

# YOLO CLAUDE IN VIBER00T:
./viber00t                          # Launch the sandbox
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions  # UNLEASHED. NO QUESTIONS. PURE SPEED.

# Claude is now:
# - Writing code WITHOUT asking
# - Executing commands WITHOUT confirmation  
# - Shipping features WITHOUT friction
# - Operating at LIGHT SPEED
```

### âš¡ WHY THIS IS THE FUTURE âš¡

**Problem**: Claude keeps asking for permissions. Every. Single. Time.  
**Solution**: viber00t + `--dangerously-skip-permissions` = **INSTANT EVERYTHING**

The flag was DESIGNED for sandboxes. viber00t IS that sandbox. Match made in c0de heaven.

## What Is viber00t? (Besides Claude's Ultimate Playground)

A **brutally simple** containerization tool that:
- ðŸš€ Gets you coding in SECONDS, not hours
- ðŸ–• Replaces Docker Desktop with something that doesn't suck
- âš¡ Auto-mounts everything you need (SSH keys, project files, creds)
- ðŸ”¥ Zero config required (but you can if you want)
- ðŸ’€ Built on Podman because Docker is corporate bloat

## The VIBEC0RE Philosophy

```
ship > plan
code > meetings  
vibes > process
chaos > order
```

This is the way.

## Quickstart (The Only Start)

```bash
# Clone the chaos
git clone https://github.com/vibec0re/viber00t
cd viber00t && go build -o viber00t

# Enter your project
cd ~/your-sick-project

# Initialize (optional, viber00t doesn't give a fuck)
~/viber00t/viber00t init

# LAUNCH
~/viber00t/viber00t

# You're now in a container. Code. Ship. Repeat.
```

That's it. That's the entire fucking manual.

## Features That Actually Matter

### Instant Everything
- Container spins up INSTANTLY
- Your project files? Already mounted
- SSH keys? There
- Git credentials? Yep
- AWS/GCP creds? Obviously

### Language Templates Built-In
```bash
# It just knows what you need
./viber00t  # Detects your project type automatically
```

Supports:
- Go (because it's based)
- Rust (because VIBEC0RE)
- Python (if you must)
- Node (ugh, fine)
- Whatever else you throw at it

### Docker-in-Podman
Need Docker inside? We got you:
```toml
[project]
privileged = true  # Now you have Docker. In Podman. Because chaos.
```

### AI Integration
```toml
[project]
agent = "claude"  # Claude joins your container. Ship faster.
```

## ðŸš¨ CLAUDE IN YOLO MODE: THE MAIN EVENT ðŸš¨

### ðŸ’€ THIS IS WHY YOU'RE HERE ðŸ’€

viber00t isn't just another container tool. It's **Claude's ultimate playground**.

```bash
# THE POWER COMBO THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING:
./viber00t                          # Sandbox: ACTIVATED
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions  # Claude: UNLEASHED

# What just happened:
# 1. viber00t created a PERFECT ISOLATION CHAMBER
# 2. Claude entered with ZERO RESTRICTIONS
# 3. You're now coding at WARP SPEED
```

### ðŸ”¥ REAL EXAMPLES OF YOLO CLAUDE IN ACTION ðŸ”¥

```bash
# EXAMPLE 1: Instant Full-Stack App
$ ./viber00t
$ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> "Build me a rust web server with auth, db, and frontend"
# Claude: *Creates 47 files, installs deps, starts server in 3 seconds*
# You: "wtf that was instant"

# EXAMPLE 2: Refactor Without Mercy
$ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> "Convert this entire Node codebase to Rust"
# Claude: *Already halfway done before you finish typing*
# No "May I?" No "Should I?" Just DONE.

# EXAMPLE 3: Fix Production Bug
$ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> "Find and fix the memory leak"
# Claude: *Analyzes, patches, tests, commits*
# Time elapsed: 12 seconds
# Meetings avoided: 7
```

### âš¡ THE TECHNICAL BREAKDOWN âš¡

**What --dangerously-skip-permissions ACTUALLY Does:**

```text
BEFORE (Traditional Claude):
â”œâ”€â”€ Check permissions â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’ Ask user â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’ Wait for approval â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’ Maybe edit
â””â”€â”€ Every. Single. Action.

AFTER (YOLO Claude in viber00t):
â””â”€â”€ JUST FUCKING DO IT â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’ DONE
```

**The Permission Bypass Stack:**
- âœ… **File Operations**: Instant writes, no confirmation dialogs
- âœ… **Command Execution**: Runs ANYTHING without asking
- âœ… **System Access**: Full container control, zero friction
- âœ… **Package Management**: Installs/removes without approval
- âœ… **Git Operations**: Commits, pushes, force-pushes (if you're brave)

### ðŸŽ¯ WHY VIBER00T + YOLO CLAUDE = PERFECTION ðŸŽ¯

```yaml
Traditional Setup:
  time_to_productivity: "45 minutes of config"
  permission_prompts: "âˆž"
  actual_coding: "maybe 20%"
  
viber00t + YOLO Claude:
  time_to_productivity: "literally 3 seconds"
  permission_prompts: "ZERO"
  actual_coding: "100% PURE SHIPPING"
```

### ðŸ’Š THE RED PILL MOMENT ðŸ’Š

**You've been living in two realities:**

1. **The Blue Pill Reality** (What you know):
   - Docker Desktop eating your RAM
   - Claude asking "May I?" every 5 seconds
   - Config files longer than your actual code
   - "DevOps" meetings about yaml indentation

2. **The Red Pill Reality** (What viber00t offers):
   - One command to rule them all
   - Claude operating at the speed of thought
   - No config unless YOU want it
   - Ship code while others debug docker-compose

### ðŸš€ ADVANCED YOLO TECHNIQUES ðŸš€

```bash
# TECHNIQUE 1: The Speed Run
$ ./viber00t && claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> "Implement the entire startup idea I just described"
# Full MVP in under 60 seconds

# TECHNIQUE 2: The Chaos Mode
$ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> "Surprise me with performance improvements"
# Claude: *Rewrites your entire caching layer in Rust*

# TECHNIQUE 3: The Time Traveler
$ claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> "Make this codebase look like I've been working all week"
# Claude: *47 commits, full test coverage, documentation*
# Your manager: "Great week of work!"
# You: *Been here 5 minutes*
```

### ðŸŽ® ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: MAXIMUM VELOCITY ðŸŽ®

When you run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` in viber00t:
- **Response Time**: INSTANT
- **Approval Dialogs**: NONE
- **Friction**: ZERO
- **Vibes**: MAXIMUM
- **Code Shipped**: ALL OF IT

**THIS IS THE WAY**: Container isolation + permission bypass = C0DE NIRVANA

## Optional Config (For Control Freaks)

Don't need this. But if you want it:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-chaos-engine"
agent = "claude"
privileged = true

[[install]]
packages = ["rust", "neovim", "chaos"]

[[volumes]]
source = "~/secrets"
target = "/c0de/secrets"

[[ports]]
host = 6969
container = 6969
```

Save as `viber00t.toml`. Or don't. viber00t doesn't care.

## Why viber00t?

### Docker Desktop
- 4GB RAM minimum
- Electron bloat
- Licensing bullshit
- Slow as fuck
- **Status: REJECTED**

### Vagrant
- VMs in 2025? Really?
- Config files longer than your code
- **Status: BOOMER TECH**

### K8s for Dev
- 47 YAML files to run hello world
- "It's what we use in prod" ðŸ¤“
- **Status: OVERENGINEERED**

### viber00t
- One command
- Zero config
- Pure vibes
- **Status: SHIPPING CODE**

## The viber00t Manifesto

```
We reject complexity.
We embrace chaos.
We ship code, not configurations.
We are the c0de witches.
This is viber00t.
```

## Commands (All Three of Them)

```bash
./viber00t         # Run your fucking container
./viber00t init    # Create a config (optional)
./viber00t clean   # Remove cached images
```

That's it. That's all the commands.

## Real Dev Quotes

*"I replaced my entire Docker Desktop setup in 30 seconds"*

*"Wait, that's it? It just works?"*

*"fuck yeah, finally someone who gets it"*

## Join the Chaos

### [ðŸš€ GET VIBER00T](https://github.com/vibec0re/viber00t)

Star it. Fork it. Break it. Fix it. Ship it.

No PRs for adding complexity. PRs for removing features welcome.
